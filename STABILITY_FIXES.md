# Snap2Health Stability Fixes

This document outlines the stability improvements made to the Snap2Health application to address various issues with reload loops, port conflicts, and script loading errors.

## Problems Addressed

1. **Reload Loops and Refresh Cycles**
   - App constantly refreshing or reloading due to emergency fix scripts
   - Conflicts between multiple error recovery scripts

2. **Port Conflicts**
   - Port 3000 remaining occupied after server shutdown
   - Errors when starting the development server

3. **Script Loading Errors**
   - `404 Not Found` errors for static assets
   - SyntaxErrors in emergency scripts
   - Issues with DOM manipulation in static-fix.js

4. **UI Rendering Issues**
   - Glitchy styling due to conflicting scripts
   - Layout shifts caused by emergency scripts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Problematic Emergency Scripts

- Deleted emergency-fix.js and related emergency scripts
- Simplified static-fix.js to prevent DOM manipulation conflicts
- Removed script tags from app/head.tsx and app/layout.tsx
- Converted emergency functions to more reliable implementations

### 2. Improved Port Management

- Enhanced kill-ports-improved.js to reliably free ports 3000-3010
- Added proper port checking and fallback mechanisms in server scripts
- Created easy-to-use kill-all-ports script for quick recovery

### 3. Better Server Implementation

- Improved clean-standalone-server.js with proper error handling
- Added cache control headers for static assets
- Implemented graceful shutdown and startup

### 4. Cache Management

- Added proper cache-busting for static assets
- Implemented cache-control headers in middleware.ts
- Simplified and cleaned up cache handling logic

### 5. Script Cleanup & Organization

- Simplified package.json scripts
- Created a unified dev:stable script for reliable development
- Made quick-fix.js script for rapid recovery
- Updated documentation for easier troubleshooting

## How to Use the New Stable Development Environment

### Recommended: Clean Start

```bash
npm run dev:stable
```

This command:
- Kills any processes using port 3000
- Cleans the build cache (.next directory and node_modules/.cache)
- Starts a clean server with proper error handling

### If You Encounter Issues

```bash
npm run fix
```

This command runs a comprehensive fix script that:
- Kills all processes on ports 3000-3010
- Cleans build caches
- Removes any remaining problematic files
- Provides instructions for starting a clean server

## Monitoring & Diagnostics

- Visit `/dev-debug` to see detailed system information
- Check console logs for error messages
- Use TROUBLESHOOTING.md for specific issues

## Deployment Changes

- Added pre-deployment checks
- Implemented proper cache-control headers for production
- Removed emergency scripts from production builds

These changes make the application more stable, maintainable, and less prone to the endless reload or styling issues that were previously occurring.
