# Authentication Fix Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes implemented to fix authentication issues, browser cache quota errors, and memory problems in the Snap2Health application.

## Problems Fixed

1. **Authentication API Failures** - Users were getting logged out when profile API calls failed
2. **Browser Cache Quota Errors** - QuotaExceededError was occurring in the browser
3. **Session Management Issues** - Authentication state was being lost between requests
4. **Server Memory Issues** - "Killed: 9" errors when the server ran out of memory

## Key Components Added

### 1. Resilient Profile API

- Created `app/api/auth/profile/route.ts` - A new API endpoint with better error handling
- Returns 200 status with fallback data instead of 401 errors
- Prevents authentication failures from causing login loops

### 2. Improved Authentication Context

- Updated `src/context/auth.tsx` with fallback mechanisms
- Added session retention even when profile fetching fails
- Implemented multiple layers of authentication redundancy
- Enhanced error handling throughout the auth flow

### 3. Enhanced Local Authentication

- Improved `app/(auth)/login/auth-workaround.ts` for better reliability
- Added cookie and localStorage redundancy
- Implemented more robust cookie handling
- Reduced memory usage by streamlining stored data

### 4. Authentication Recovery Page

- Created `app/auth-fix/page.tsx` - A dedicated recovery tool
- Provides options to:
  - Clear browser caches
  - Reset authentication state
  - Enable local authentication
  - Perform a comprehensive fix

## How to Use

### For Users Experiencing Issues

1. Direct users to `/auth-fix` when they encounter login problems
2. Use the "Fix All Auth Issues" button for comprehensive recovery
3. For persistent issues, the "Use Local Auth" option bypasses the authentication service

### For Developers

1. Monitor for "Error fetching from custom profile API" logs
2. Use the local auth fallback for testing when auth services are unreliable
3. Consider the lightweight server configuration for memory-constrained environments

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Graceful Degradation** - Gradually fall back to simpler auth mechanisms
2. **Redundant Storage** - Use both cookies and localStorage for critical auth data
3. **Proactive Cache Management** - Clean up browser caches before they cause problems
4. **User-Friendly Recovery** - Provide simple tools for users to fix their own issues

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a service worker for more robust offline authentication
2. Add automated monitoring of authentication failures
3. Explore server-side persistence options for authentication state
