3. **Cache Issues:** Adds proper cache-busting headers to prevent stale content
4. **Image Upload Failures:** Fixes the upload-image API route
5. **Stuck Loading States:** Updates emergency scripts to prevent infinite loading
6. **Static/Dynamic Rendering:** Forces all API routes to be dynamic to prevent build errors

## Manual Verification

After deploying, verify these key features:

1. **Authentication:** Can you log in successfully?
2. **Image Upload:** Can you upload a food image?
3. **Analysis:** Does the nutrition analysis display correctly?
4. **Navigation:** Can you navigate between pages without page reloads?
