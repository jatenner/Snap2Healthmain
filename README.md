### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
<<<<<<< HEAD
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snap2health.git
   cd snap2health
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file with the following:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:stable
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Reliable Usage Commands

Snap2Health includes several utility scripts for reliable operation:

- `npm run dev:stable` - Start development server with clean ports and caches (recommended)
- `npm run dev:clean` - Start development server after cleaning .next directory
- `npm run kill-ports` - Kill all processes on ports 3000-3010
- `npm run clean` - Clean all caches (.next, node_modules/.cache)
- `npm run fix` - Run comprehensive fixes for common issues

## Stability Improvements

Recent improvements have addressed several issues:

- Fixed infinite reload loops and emergency script interference
- Resolved port conflicts and server startup issues
- Improved authentication stability with better fallbacks
- Enhanced script loading and asset caching
- Optimized static file delivery and error handling

For more details on stability improvements, see [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md).

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
